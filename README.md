This is an android based app as a part of my networking based project.
This app is basically a file transfer between your android phone and your desktop/laptop as a server.
The server as it gets file, plays the file.
The php file needs to be opened on the browser.
I have created my laptop as a server,
using xampp and have made use of google's Storage Access framework that allows file selection from your cell phone.
I also made use of Loopj API that allows HTTP Communication.
Till now I just added support for image playing,
I am working on it to support for various types of files like videos,music etc and will get back to this readme asap.
